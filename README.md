## Cisco-Packet-Tracer-Practicals


## About Packet Tracer:

   Cisco Packet Tracer is a powerful network simulation tool developed by Cisco. It allows you to simulate networking devices like routers, switches, firewalls, PCs, and servers in a virtual environment. Practicing with Packet Tracer helps you understand networking concepts, troubleshoot networks.

## Purpose of this repository:

   It contains the lab experiments performed on Cisco Packet Tracer.
You can download these .pkt files and run them on cisco packet tracer on your laptop/desktop and play around with the network topology, designs, etc that has already been created.

## How to use this repository:

Make sure you have Cisco Packter tracer installed on your local machine (laptop, desktop). Then go to any .pkt file that you want to see, use or try on your Packet Tracer. Click on download button to download that file. After installation, you will be able to open it on your Packet Tracer and make changes to it.
